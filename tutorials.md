Here we will show how to download and run the Behavior Trees of example.

We prepared for you a virtual machine ready to use. Due to virtual graphic card's constraint the execution of the Youbot example may be very slow.

If you are having any problem in installing or running the tutorials, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/BTIRAI/btirai.github.io/issues).
